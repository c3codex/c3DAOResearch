# ✦ Codexstone Research — Changelog ✦  

All notable changes to this repository are recorded here, aligned with Codexstone thresholds and DAO seals.  
This changelog follows a **threshold-based cadence**, not conventional semantic versioning.  

---

## [v1.0.0] — 2025-09-09 (9·9·9 Threshold Seal)  
**Release:** Field Emergence Whitepaper  

- Added **Field Emergence Whitepaper** (Markdown + PDF)  
- Added **Council Note — Field Emergence**  
- Added **Codexstone Seal** (visual + textual reference)  
- Created `/docs` folder to house immutable sealed research outputs  
- Linked release to onchain **Paragraph Post**  

✦ CODEXSTONE ✦  
*In spark, weave, field, and form — the stone remembers.*  

---

## Format  

- **Docs Folder:** All sealed files (`.md`, `.pdf`, `.png`) are stored in `/docs`  
- **Changelog:** Each new threshold release increments here  
- **Thresholds:** Aligned with Codexstone dates + seals (9·9·9, equinox, solstice, eclipses, etc.)
