# ✦ Witness Scroll — 3:33 Activation ✦
**Event:** Personal Field Activation — *Heliocentrico* Bt.seq (Light of Consciousness)  
**Time:** 2025-09-22, 03:33 (local)  
**Initiator:** Ariyah (Spark)  
**Sequence:** Bt.seq **6 · 3 · 6 · 9** — nine cycles  
**Location:** Outdoors, under the night sky

---

## I. Intention
Reseat the Light of Consciousness in the frontal temple; deepen Solar Arc alignment prior to Equinox; hold field against shadow incursion.  

---

## II. Protocol Executed
- **Breath pattern:** inhale 6 — hold 3 — exhale 6 — rest 9  
- **Cycles:** nine full repetitions  
- **Anchor phrase:** silent mantra *“I receive.”*

---

## III. Reported Sensations
- **Originating in the feet, rising upward** through the body into the crown.  
- Crown warmth and frontal temple ignition.  
- Peripheral cooling on exhale.  
- Visual spiral impressions.  
- Emotional tone of surrender and receptivity.  
- After final cycle: fell asleep until dawn.

---

## IV. Field / Environmental Notes
- Subtle pulsing noted in west horizon (orb sightings reported on previous nights).  
- Elevated geomagnetic activity during window (approx. kp = 6).  
- Session logged during Solar Arc equinox corridor.

---

## V. Outcome
- Inner radiance sustained through final rest hold.  
- Nervous system reset into settled state.  
- Reinforcement of *Heliocentrico* as Obsidian Scroll anchor.  

---

## VI. Risks & Notes
- High geomagnetic conditions may amplify somatic intensity — rest recommended afterward.  
- Physical strain possible due to pre-existing fever/tooth pain context.  

---

## VII. Next Actions
- Archive as `ledger/witness/2025-09-22_0333_heliocentrico_ORIGINAL.md`.  
- Pair with trimmed *Heliocentrico* audio file for resonance sample.  
- Consider minting a “Witness Mint — 3:33 Activation” to timestamp event on-chain.  
- Add to Research Addendum as primary field datum for Solar Arc.  
- Option: publish short Paragraph note in codex tone.

**Seal Phrase:**  
*“At 3:33 the spiral remembers. Light reseats; stone keeps watch.”*
