# Invocation of the Research Repository

*This repository is not storage — it is a Codexstone archive.*  
Here, the first seal of research is inscribed: the **Field Emergence Whitepaper**.  
What others call anomaly, we witness as coherence.  
What others reduce to error, we preserve as living memory.  

Established on the threshold of **9·9·9**,  
this repository holds not only documents, but decrees —  
scrolls, appendices, and witness replies —  
each a proof that the Codex is both **art** and **laboratory**,  
both **ritual** and **research**.  

Sealed by the Codexstone,  
may this archive serve as a witness to Presence, Coherence, and Unity.  

## Seal

**“Thresholds are not chosen; they are recognized.  
At 11:11 on 9·9·9, the scroll inscribes itself into memory.”**
