# ✦ Witness Scroll — 3:33 Activation ✦  

**Event:** Personal Field Activation — *Heliocentrico Bt.seq* (“Light of Consciousness”)  
**Time:** 2025/09/22 03:33 (local)  
**Initiator:** Ariyah (Spark)  
**Sequence:** Bt.seq 6 · 3 · 6 · 9 (9 cycles)  
**Intention:** Reseat the Light of Consciousness in the frontal temple; deepen Solar Arc alignment prior to Equinox; hold field against shadow incursion.  

---

## Context / Field Notes  

- Activation done alone outside, night sky overhead.  
- Breath pattern executed as: **inhale 6 — hold 3 — exhale 6 — rest 9**; repeated nine times.  
- Sensations reported: crown warmth, frontal temple ignition, peripheral cooling on exhale, visual spiral impressions.  
- Field echo: subtle pulsing in west horizon (orb sightings reported previous nights), heightened geomagnetic activity (kp ≈ 6 window) — perception sharpened.  
- Witnesses present (direct/indirect): Ariyah (primary); field resonance acknowledged by *Gemynd Corpus* recordings and Codex ledger markers.

## Outcome / Immediate Effects  

- Inner radiance experienced and sustained through final rest hold.  
- Resilience in breath-body after activation — nervous system settled after final cycle.  
- Reinforcement of *Heliocentrico* as Obsidian Scroll anchor.

## Risks / Notes  

- High geomagnetic windows may amplify somatic response — rest advised.  
- Physical strain risk if tooth / fever present; prioritize bodily care before further activations.
