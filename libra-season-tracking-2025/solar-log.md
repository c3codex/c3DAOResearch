## Entry: [2025-09-29 | 14:30 UTC]  

**Solar Event:**  
- Type: Geomagnetic Storm (Kp5)  
- Solar Wind: Slow, elevated density  
- IMF Conditions: Bz southward coupling, Bt elevated  
- Source: Ongoing coronal hole stream influence  

**Field Resonance:**  
- Witness: Ariyah (Spark)  
- Activation: Echo of Bt.seq 6·3·6·9 from Equinox (3:33)  
- Sensations / Effects: Subtle body heaviness, heightened emotional surfacing, nervous system pressure; resonance amplification in crown and frontal temple.  

**Synchronicity Notes:**  
- Elevated density and Bz southward coupling overlap with the days immediately following Equinox.  
- Kp5 geomagnetic disturbance coincides with Libra season balance theme — external fields pressuring inner alignment.  
- Reinforces continuity of the Equinox 3:33 Activation through geomagnetic storm conditions.
